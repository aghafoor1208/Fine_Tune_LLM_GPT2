# Fine Tune Large Language Model (GPT2)

This project fine-tunes the GPT-2 language model on the tweet_sentiment_extraction dataset to improve its ability to extract sentiment-relevant portions of tweets. The model is trained to identify and highlight phrases that convey the sentiment of a tweet, enhancing the accuracy and precision of sentiment extraction. This approach leverages GPT-2's language understanding to create a robust tool for sentiment analysis in social media contexts.
